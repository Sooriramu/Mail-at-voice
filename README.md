What if a visually/physically challenged person needs to send a mail when nobody is beside to assist him?

"Mail at voice" is developed based on this use case. This is a customized application to use the mailing feature without any kind of touch activities. 
Yeah, you read that right!

Starting from login to providing confirmation to send a mail, everything works only based on voice controls. This is highly beneficial for persons with disabilities who can't access existing regular mailing feature.

"Android studio" is used as the front-end tool and connected to a "SQLite" database for storing the login credentials in local device.
